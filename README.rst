Stores IPython notebooks automagically onto OpenStack clouds through Swift.

*Add your provider with a pull request!*

**Note: Bookstore requires IPython 1.0+**

Bookstore currently has generic support for OpenStack Swift and simplified
authentication for Rackspace's CloudFiles. Bookstore also handles IPython notebook's
autosave/checkpoint feature and as of the latest release supports multiple checkpoints:

Once installed and configured (added to an ipython profile), just launch
IPython notebook like normal:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ipython notebook

Installation
------------

Simply:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install bookstore

Alternatively, you can always pull from the master branch if you're the adventurous type:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/rgbkrk/bookstore.git

Installation isn't the end though. You need to configure your account details
as well as where you'll be storing the notebooks.

Configuration
-------------

Note on Mac OS X:

libcloud (what bookstore is using under the hood), has trouble finding the Mac's CA Certs

You'll need to set where your SSL_CERT_FILE is located

.. code-block:: bash

  $ export SSL_CERT_FILE=/usr/local/opt/curl-ca-bundle/share/ca-bundle.crt

If it's not on your system already, you'll need toinstall the curl ca bundle, either directly or via brew:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ brew install curl-ca-bundle
  ==> Downloading https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/machomebrew/mirror/curl-ca-bundle-1.87.tar.bz2
  ######################################################################## 100.0%
  ==> Caveats
  To use these certificates with OpenSSL:
  
    export SSL_CERT_FILE=/usr/local/opt/curl-ca-bundle/share/ca-bundle.crt
    ==> Summary

Bookstore has to be added to an IPython profile and configured to work with
your OpenStack provider.

If you want to keep it simple, just add your configuration to the default configuration located at:

.. code-block:: bash

    ~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_notebook_config.py

Alternatively, you can create a brand new notebook profile for bookstore:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ipython profile create swiftstore
    [ProfileCreate] Generating default config file: u'/Users/theuser/.ipython/profile_swiftstore/ipython_config.py'
    [ProfileCreate] Generating default config file: u'/Users/theuser/.ipython/profile_swiftstore/ipython_notebook_config.py'

When launching, just set the custom profile you want to use

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ipython notebook --profile=swiftstore

Each provider has their own setup for authentication.

On OpenStack Swift using Keystone Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenStack (generic, non provider specific) has quite a few details you'll need
to configure, namely account name, account key, auth endpoint, and region.
You'll possibly need a tenant id and a tenant name.

Add this to your ipython notebook profile *ipython_notebook_config.py*, making
sure it comes after the config declaration ``c = get_config()``.

.. code-block:: python

    # Setup IPython Notebook to write notebooks to a Swift Cluster
    # that uses Keystone for authentication
    c.NotebookApp.notebook_manager_class = 'bookstore.swift.KeystoneNotebookManager'

    # Account details for OpenStack
    c.KeystoneNotebookManager.account_name = USER_NAME
    c.KeystoneNotebookManager.account_key = API_KEY
    c.KeystoneNotebookManager.auth_endpoint = u'127.0.0.1:8021'
    c.KeystoneNotebookManager.tenant_id = TENANT_ID
    c.KeystoneNotebookManager.tenant_name = TENANT_NAME
    c.KeystoneNotebookManager.region = 'RegionOne'

    # Container on OpenStack Swift
    c.KeystoneNotebookManager.container_name = u'notebooks'

On Rackspace's CloudFiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Rackspace CloudFileNotebookManager simply needs your ``USER_NAME`` and ``API_KEY``. You can also configure the region to store your notebooks (e.g. ``'SYD'``, ``'ORD'``, ``'DFW'``, ``'LON'``). Note: If you're using Rackspace UK, set your region to ``'LON'``.

Add this to your ipython notebook profile *ipython_notebook_config.py*, making
sure it comes after the config declaration ``c = get_config()``.

.. code-block:: python

    # Setup IPython Notebook to write notebooks to CloudFiles
    c.NotebookApp.notebook_manager_class = 'bookstore.cloudfiles.CloudFilesNotebookManager'

    # Set your user name and API Key
    c.CloudFilesNotebookManager.account_name = USER_NAME
    c.CloudFilesNotebookManager.account_key = API_KEY

    # Container on CloudFiles
    c.CloudFilesNotebookManager.container_name = u'notebooks'
